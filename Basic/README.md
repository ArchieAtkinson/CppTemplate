# Basic
This repo is a simple project template for C/C++ to get your project up and running using CMake and VSCode.

This project uses CMake and therefore the file type (.c or .cpp) dictates which compiler is used. If you want this to be a C project, ensure source files have the .c extension. For C++ the .cpp extension.

This repo is using the [basic window](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/blob/master/examples/core/core_basic_window.c) example provided in the [raylib repo](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) to provide a starting point.  

## Compiler, Build and VSCode

To get this program up and running just follow the instructions in the [Main README](https://github.com/ArchieAtkinson/CppTemplate/blob/main/README.md). 

Note: The configuring CMake step may take a couple of minutes as it needs to download the Raylib repo. 

Onced you have followed all the steps and run the program you'll see a window displaying `"Congrats! You created your first window!"`.


## End Note
This repo is designed to help people new to C++ get started. I'm still fairly new to CMake, C++ and Open Source project. I would love any feedback, so please raise an Issue on the Github page if you have any! If you have any issues with the steps in this repo, just create an issue on Github and I'll do my best to help!
